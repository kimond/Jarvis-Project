VoxForge & Julius Quick Start.

This Tar file contains everything you need to get Julius working:
 * Julius Run-time engine executable;
 * VoxForge Acoustic Model files;
 * VoxForge sample Grammar files.

Simply extract the gzipped tar file to a directory, and execute the following command:
 
 $./julius -input mic -C Sample.jconf

For information on the Julius grammar syntax, see the enclosed GRAMMAR_NOTES.

Note that the Acoustic Models are still 'alpha'.  As a result, the quality of speech recognition is 
only fair.  This is not a fault of the Julius Speech Recognition Engine, it is because we need much
more GPL transcribed speech audio to create decent quality Acoustic Models.  So please take the time 
to submit some transcribed speech to www.voxforge.org.

thanks,

the VoxForge team.
